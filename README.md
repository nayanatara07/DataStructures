# Data-Structures

This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms in the field of computer science.

## Searching Techniques
- **Linear Search:** A simple search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a list.
- **Binary Search:** An efficient search algorithm that works on sorted arrays, dividing the search interval in half at each step.

## Sorting Techniques
- **Selection Sort:** A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly selects the minimum element and puts it at the beginning.
- **Insertion Sort:** A simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time.
- **Bubble Sort:** A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
- **Merge Sort:** An efficient, stable, and comparison-based sorting algorithm that divides the array into two halves, sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves.
- **Quick Sort:** A fast sorting algorithm that employs a divide-and-conquer strategy to sort elements.

## Stack
- Implementation of a stack data structure.

## Queue
- Implementation of a queue data structure.

## Linked Lists
- **Single Linked List:** A linear collection of elements where each element points to the next in the sequence.
- **Double Linked List:** A linked list in which each node contains a data part and two pointers, one pointing to the next node in the sequence and another pointing to the previous node.

## Circular Linked Lists
- **Single Circular Linked List:** Similar to a single linked list, but the last node points back to the first node.
- **Double Circular Linked List:** Similar to a double linked list, but the last node points back to the first node, and the previous pointer of the first node points to the last node.

## Binary Tree
- Implementation of a binary tree data structure.
