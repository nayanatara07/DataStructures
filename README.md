# Data-Structures

This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms in the field of computer science.

## Searching Techniques
- [**Linear Search:**](Linear_search.py) A simple search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a list.
- [**Binary Search:**](Binary_search.py) An efficient search algorithm that works on sorted arrays, dividing the search interval in half at each step.

## Sorting Techniques
- [**Selection Sort:**](Selection_sort.py) A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly selects the minimum element and puts it at the beginning.
- [**Insertion Sort:**](Insertion_sort.py) A simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time.
- [**Bubble Sort:**](Bubble_sort.py) A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
- [**Merge Sort:**](Merge_sort.py) An efficient, stable, and comparison-based sorting algorithm that divides the array into two halves, sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves.
- [**Quick Sort:**](Quick_sort.py) A fast sorting algorithm that employs a divide-and-conquer strategy to sort elements.

## [Stack](Stack.py)
- Implementation of a stack data structure.

## [Queue](Queue.py)
- Implementation of a queue data structure.

## Linked Lists
- [**Single Linked List:**](Single_linkedlist.py) A linear collection of elements where each element points to the next in the sequence.
- [**Double Linked List:**](Double_linkedlist.py) A linked list in which each node contains a data part and two pointers, one pointing to the next node in the sequence and another pointing to the previous node.

## Circular Linked Lists
- [**Single Circular Linked List:**](Circular_SingleLL.py) Similar to a single linked list, but the last node points back to the first node.
- [**Double Circular Linked List:**](Circular_DoubleLL.py) Similar to a double linked list, but the last node points back to the first node, and the previous pointer of the first node points to the last node.

## [Binary Tree](Binary_Tree.py)
- Implementation of a binary tree data structure.
